Yelp Project Proposal 

Our project is to uncover the difference between using Yelp data sets from csv files and from the API key. We would like to figure out which data set is more reliable in looking for the most popular business and location. The work is presented in a detailed Jupyter notebook. 

Null Hypothesis: Business data sets from csv files and from the API key will have the similar results such as tables, graphs, ratings, number of reviews.

Alternate Hypothesis: Business data sets from csv files and from the API key will not have the similar results such as tables, graphs, ratings, number of reviews.

This project uses the Yelp Open Dataset which includes 7 files:
- yelp_business.csv
- yelp_business_attributes.csv
- yelp_business_hours.csv
- yelp_checkin.csv
- yelp_review.csv
- yelp_tip.csv
- yelp_user.csv
